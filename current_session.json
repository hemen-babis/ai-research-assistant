The project for your Applied Linear Algebra course involves applying linear algebra concepts to solve a real-world problem using MATLAB. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key components and requirements:\n\n### 1. **Project Structure and Teamwork**\n- **Group Work:** You are required to work in groups of 4 to 6 students. You need to form your groups by November 22 and submit the list of members via email.\n- **Collaboration:** The project emphasizes teamwork, and part of your grade will be based on how effectively your group collaborates.\n\n### 2. **Project Topic**\n- **Selection:** You must choose a project topic from a list provided in the \"ProjectOptions.pdf\" document.\n\n### 3. **Objectives**\n- **Linear Algebra Application:** Utilize techniques such as matrix operations, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, or least squares.\n- **MATLAB Proficiency:** Develop your skills in MATLAB, which you will use to implement and solve the problem.\n- **Communication:** Enhance your ability to communicate complex findings through a professional report.\n\n### 4. **Deliverables**\n- **MATLAB Code:** Submit well-documented and error-free MATLAB code with sample inputs and outputs.\n- **Written Report:** Your report should include several sections: Title Page, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and References. It should clearly describe the problem, the methods used, the results (including visualizations), and discuss the findings and any challenges encountered.\n- **Group Contribution Statement:** Provide a detailed account of each member's contributions to the project.\n\n### 5. **Evaluation Criteria**\n- **Mathematical Accuracy (25%):** Correct application of linear algebra concepts.\n- **Computational Implementation (20%):** Functionality, efficiency, and documentation of the MATLAB code.\n- **Report Quality (35%):** Overall clarity, structure, and depth of analysis in the report.\n- **Visualizations and Presentation (10%):** Effectiveness of visual aids in enhancing understanding of the content.\n- **Group Collaboration (10%):** Evidence of equitable contribution and effective teamwork.\n\n### 6. **Submission and Deadlines**\n- **Deadline:** All project components must be uploaded to Canvas by December 11. No late submissions will be accepted.\n\n### 7. **Policies and Support**\n- **Academic Integrity:** Ensure all work is original. Any form of plagiarism or copying will lead to a failing grade for the project.\n- **Support:** You are encouraged to attend office hours for assistance related to MATLAB or project issues. Online resources and tutorials for MATLAB are also recommended.\n\n### 8. **Additional Guidance**\n- **Instructor Assistance:** You can contact the instructor, Li Zhu, or visit during office hours for additional help or clarification on the project.\n\nThis project is an opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge from your course in a practical, real-world context, enhancing both your technical and collaborative skills."}, {"question": "thank you, which project do you recommend me to work on", "answer": "I'm unable to directly recommend a specific project topic for you as I don't have access to the \"ProjectOptions.pdf\" document mentioned in the guidelines. However, I can suggest how to choose a suitable project based on your interests and the objectives of the course:\n\n1. **Interest and Relevance:** Choose a topic that genuinely interests you or is relevant to your future career goals. This will keep you motivated throughout the project.\n\n2. **Scope and Complexity:** Ensure the topic is neither too simple nor too complex. It should be challenging enough to apply various linear algebra techniques but feasible within the given time frame and with the resources available.\n\n3. **Team Skills:** Consider the strengths and interests of your team members. A topic that allows each member to contribute effectively and learn from the project would be ideal.\n\n4. **Resource Availability:** Make sure you have access to all the necessary resources and data needed for the project. Lack of essential resources can hinder your progress.\n\n5. **Innovative Aspect:** Since there is encouragement to apply creative uses of linear algebra, think about how your project can incorporate unique approaches or solve problems in innovative ways.\n\nOnce you have access to the \"ProjectOptions.pdf,\" evaluate each option against these criteria. Discuss with your group members to reach a consensus on the topic that best meets these guidelines and aligns with your collective interests and strengths."}]}
